The Portuguese government isdropping taxesfor those 35 years and under to encourage foreigners to move to the country, and young residents to stop from emigrating. This could benefit anywhere from 350,000 and 400,000 young people. Portugal has one of the lowest salaries in Europe, causing many people (especially the youth) to move out of the country in hopes to make better wages elsewhere. For context, the monthly minimum wage in the country comes to €870 (~$945).",

According to theNASA Meteor Watch on Facebook, the knowledge of the meteor’s trajectory is very rudimentary due to no currently available camera or satellite data. But with the help of eye witnesses and the American Meteor Society, they’ve been able to come to an understanding. NASA originally estimated “that the fireball was first sighted at an altitude of 49 miles above Upper Bay (east of Greenville Yard). ” From there, they believed the meteor passed over the Statue of Liberty after moving a little east of North and descending at 18 degrees from vertical, where it finally disintegrated 29 miles aboveMidtown, Manhattan.",

Through interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), they found that theareas of NYC that were sinking at various rates had previously been modified, whether that be from land reclamation or the construction of landfills. Thus, making the surface looser and more susceptible to compress under buildings. “We’ve produced such a detailed map of vertical land motion in the New York City area that there are features popping out that haven’t been noticed before,” said lead author Brett Buzzanga, a postdoctoral researcher at JPL.",
