        "description": "Theannual fall foliage reportfor the area is updated every week throughout the season indicating where and when to visit, so be sure to take advantage and schedule a weekend trip before winter officially begins. Whether you’re a native New Yorker or are just visiting, taking a drive outside of the five boroughs toenjoy apple pickingor to bask in the beauty of the autumn leaves is well worth it. And based on the fall foliage report, the autumn color foliage is beginning to change and peak in upstate NY! While some of these locations are way further than others (basically in Canada) we promise, the beauty is worthy of the drive. So although we can fight all day aboutwhere “upstate” really begins, at the end of the day what we really mean here is anything above Westchester County.",

Their on-air quarrel got particularly heated after reporter Chris Cuomo says he doesn’t believe in rules and tells his brother “there’s always time to call mom, she wants to hear from you. ” Governor Cuomo did not take these back-to-back jabs lightly and immediately snaps back that he actuallyhascalled Mom, while brother Chris quickly butts in to say “that’s not what she said. ” Chris goes as far as to say that the Governor “has blown the credibility of the entire interview” by “lying to [his] audience” about who their mother’s favorite child is. If you missed the hilarious moment on Monday night, you can watch it all play out in the clip below: two cuomos on live tv arguing which cuomo was the more loved cuomo is making me laughhttps://t.",

But no matter what year, we can all acknowledge what an amazing city New York truly is! As we come to the end of the 2010s and prepare for the start of the 2020s, here are some of the biggest changes NYC has seen in the past decade: From substantial additions to the city’s skyline to the rapid development of certain neighborhoods, we’ve definitely seenmanychanges to the very streets of NY over the past decade. Statistics show that city constructionhas hit another record high(according to the number of building permits), and shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, the New York Building Congress reported that spending on construction projects will likely increase by another 10 percent by the end of the year, according to theNew York Daily News.",

        "description": "Mentalist Jason Susan has performed in venues such as SoHo House and Carnegie Hall. Now, he’s demonstrating his skills to the masses with a Victorian-era inspired seance. When you purchase your ticket you’ll be given the Williamsburg address to the apartment where your journey will unfold. During that time, 13 people will form a circle as Suran takes you to The Other Side. The Victorian-era seances are known for being more of a performance of mind-reading than a true connection to the spirits beyond.",
