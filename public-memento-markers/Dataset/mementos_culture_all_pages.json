The Portuguese government isdropping taxesfor those 35 years and under to encourage foreigners to move to the country, and young residents to stop from emigrating. This could benefit anywhere from 350,000 and 400,000 young people. Portugal has one of the lowest salaries in Europe, causing many people (especially the youth) to move out of the country in hopes to make better wages elsewhere. For context, the monthly minimum wage in the country comes to €870 (~$945).",

Luckily, NYC gives you ample opportunity to do that, with statues, murals and other memorials highlighting incredible women and/or championing the power of women in general! Here are some of our favorites, with a map at the end as well to make them easier to find! This statue was unveiled in the summer of 2020…and it was the first one ofrealwomen in Central Park, ever! Previous statues in the park that represented women were fictional beings, like Alice in Wonderland, Mother Goose, and Juliet (with Romeo).",
