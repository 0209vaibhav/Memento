        "description": "Be sure to look to the night this weekend to catch the very last full moon of the year illuminating the sky in a grand display of celestial wonder! The end of year lunar event will reach peak illumination at4:02am EST on Sunday, December 15th. Don’t fret if you won’t be up that early though, becauseNASAnotes that the moon willappear full for about three days,from Friday evening through Monday morning, making it a full moon weekend! The phenomenon of a full moon occurs whenEarth gets sandwiched between the Sun and the Moonand we Earthlings get a full view of the sun illuminating the moon, making it appear full. It’s really only 100% full during a lunar eclipse, however–considering the moon’s rotation and the fact that we only ever see the same side of the moon, part of it tends to be in shadow, explainsSpace.",
