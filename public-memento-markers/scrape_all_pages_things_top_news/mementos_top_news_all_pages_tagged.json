        "description": "If you earned some extra cash recently by reselling tickets at unthinkable prices, get ready to (potentially) get hit with taxes as theIRS is now cracking down on ticket resellers. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act, a new law will require ticketing platforms, such as Ticketmaster and StubHub, to hand over information onanyone who made more than $600 reselling ticketsthis year to the IRS. This new law lowers the tax reporting threshold for users of e-commerce platforms, which previously only applied to those who received$20,000 in revenue and had more than 200 transactions. The news comes shortly after Beyonc√©‚Äôs Renaissance tour and Taylor Swift‚Äôs Eras tour sawaverage resale ticket prices reaching heights of $900 and $1,095respectively, either breaking the bank for fans or unfortunately leaving them ticketless. Regardless of whether or not they made a profit, sellers who have made $600 or more over the course of a yearwill be sent a 1099-K form to complete, though they‚Äôll only be charged additional taxes if they earned a profit by selling tickets at higher amounts than they paid themselves.",

The new map shows how the subway tracks connect and interact with each other in a clearer way‚Äì for instance, in the current design, different lines are combined into one at points when they run together, but the new design actually shows them all separated, just running parallel to one another. The new design is quite similar to a subway map design from the ‚Äô70s, by Massimo Vignelli, which was only used for a few year before it was scrapped by the department.

        "description": "Rolf‚Äôs German Restaurant has been a staple in Gramercy for over 50 years, serving Alsatian cuisine, the region in France with heavy German influence. But it became an Instagram favorite because of its extravagant floor-to-ceiling Christmas ornaments, twinkle lights and ribbon adorning the space each year, going up in the fall and continuing through the spring. People would often line up around the block to get a chance to bask in all the restaurant‚Äôs holiday glory. But unfortunately, not this year. Though it doesn‚Äôt appear to have opened again since the pandemic began in March, a message was postedon their websitethat read: Rolf‚Äôs will reopen in the New Year 2021 when a vaccine becomes available and all the restrictions associated with COVID-19 cease to exist so we come back to normal.",

During the time of the Skyscraper Race in the 1920s-30s, former vice president of General Motors and builder of the Empire State Building, Jacob Raskob, competed with the the Chrysler Building to construct the tallest skyscraper in New York City. In order to beat out the Chrysler Building, Raskob added a 200-foot spire to the Empire State Building claiming that ‚ÄúIt needs a hat‚Äù as mentioned by6sqft, bringing the entire structure to a total of 1,250 ft tall, surpassing the Chrysler Building. But over the years it became weathered and was even littered with broadcasting equipment since it was actually once a prime spot for antennas! So, beginning in June of last year, the Empire State Realty Trust worked between the 88th and 103rd floors to remove unnecessary material and outdated antennas to revive this art deco spire.",
